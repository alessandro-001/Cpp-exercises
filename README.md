## About
This repository is my personal learning space for C++ programming. I use it to:

- Track my progress and development in C++.
- Showcase how I solve various programming exercises.
- Store code and solutions to exercises I've completed.
- Practice and experiment with C++ concepts.
- Share my journey with others who may find it useful.

## Getting Started

You can explore the exercises and solutions I've been working on by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alessandro-001/Cpp-exercises.git
```
Navigate through the folders to access exercises and their solutions.

## Prerequisites
C++ environment already installed in your computer and VCS C++ Extension

## Compiling and running

```bash
1. g++ filename.cpp 
2. ./a.out
```
Replace filename.cpp with the name of the C++ file you want to compile and output (./a.out) after.
